# Bootstrap

In this tutorial we will not start completely from scratch as the aim is to explain our process of creating Flexn template and also showcase the befits of using Flexn Create.

## Bootstrap Flexn template

To avoid having to configure plugins, engines and various other settings we will start with `@flexn/template`, however unlike in quick start we will delete all the src files, meaning we get a fresh start and start focusing on what matters - the multiplatform code.

> If you want to learn more about the configurations and plugin management or bootstrapping process, head over to [`rnv` website](https://www.renative.org).

Let's start by creating a new RNV project:

```shell
rnv new --projectTemplate @flexn/template
```

- Follow the instructions on your cli:
- Enter you project's name, title, app ID (or skip this step by clicking Enter), version;
- If you have multiple workspaces available, select rnv:

<div style={{width: 400}}>

![HelloFlexn](/img/tutorial/step1.png)

</div>

- Select the template version you want to use - Latest is recommended;
- Follow the rest of instructions on your cli;
- Navigate to your project's folder;
- Run command below and select your preferable platform to run:

```shell
rnv run
```

- Follow the rest of instructions on your cli;
- Now you should see the orginal template (you can see Apple TV example bellow);

<div style={{width: 800}}>

![HelloFlexn](/img/tutorial/step5.png)

</div>

## The advanced part

In order to understand our process of creating this template and learn more about multiplatform development lets handicap ourselves first by deleting the `src` folder. You can do that using command below or do it manually via IDE/file manager.

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="mac" label="macOS" default>

```shell
rm -R -f src
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

```cmd
rmdir src /s /q
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```shell
rm -R -f src
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
