# Example App

It's optional step, but if you want to see how Flexn Create looks in action follow steps below.

> Let's start by creating a new RNV project:

```shell
rnv new --projectTemplate @flexn/create-template-starter
```

-   Follow the instructions on your cli:
-   Enter you project's name, title, app ID (or skip this step by clicking Enter), version;
-   If you have multiple workspaces available, select rnv:

<img src={step1} alt="Example banner" width="400px" />

-   Select the template version you want to use - Latest is recommended;
-   Follow the rest of instructions on your cli;
-   Navigate to your project's folder;
-   Run command below for tvos, or type in your preferable platform to run:

```shell
rnv run -p tvos
```

-   Follow the rest of instructions on your cli;
-   You're done!

<img src={step5} alt="Example banner" width="800px" />
