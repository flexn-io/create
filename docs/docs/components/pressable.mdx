# Pressable

Pressable is one of [React Native core components](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable) but optimized to work on multiplatform environment and has awareness of Focus Manager with set of optimized animations.

## Usage

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import { App, Screen, Text, Pressable, StyleSheet } from '@flexn/create';

const MyComponent = () => {
    return (
        <App>
            <Screen style={styles.container}>
                <Pressable style={styles.button} onPress={() => console.log('Pressed')}>
                    <Text>Press me</Text>
                </Pressable>
            </Screen>
        </App>
    );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
        backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF',
    },
    button: {
        marginHorizontal: 20,
        borderWidth: 2,
        borderRadius: 25,
        borderColor: '#111111',
        height: 50,
        width: 200,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
    },
});

export default MyComponent;
```

## Props

It inherits all the properties from [React Native Pressable](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable) and adds everything what's described below.

<Prop value="focus" />
<Badge value="Android TV, Fire TV, Apple TV" platform />{' '}

Type: _boolean_

Default value: `true`

Property which tells Focus Manager if component should be included in focus engine finding next focusable element.

---

<Prop value="focusContext" />
<Badge required />
<Badge value="Android TV, Fire TV, Apple TV, webOS, Tizen" platform />{' '}

Type: _FocusContext_

This property allows Focus Manager to understand what's the structure of the screen. Usually Focus Manager iterates all the components
and passes down `focusContext` of the parent component to it's children. But if you have to created custom component you must pass it down by
yourself.

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import { App, Screen, Text, Pressable, StyleSheet, FocusContext } from '@flexn/create';

const MyCustomComponent = ({ focusContext }: { focusContext?: FocusContext }) => {
    return (
        <Pressable focusContext={focusContext} style={styles.button} onPress={() => console.log('Pressed')}>
            <Text>Press me</Text>
        </Pressable>
    );
};

const MyComponent = () => {
    return (
        <App>
            <Screen style={styles.container}>
                <MyCustomComponent />
            </Screen>
        </App>
    );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
        backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF',
    },
    button: {
        marginHorizontal: 20,
        borderWidth: 2,
        borderRadius: 25,
        borderColor: '#111111',
        height: 50,
        width: 200,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
    },
});

export default MyComponent;
```
