# FlashList

High performance list powered by [Shopify Flash List](https://github.com/Shopify/flash-list) designed to work with high amount of items.
Flash List reusing views that are no longer visible to render items instead of creating new view object.

## Usage

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import { App, FlashList, Pressable, Image, CreateListRenderItemInfo } from '@flexn/create';

const MyComponent = () => {
    const [data] = React.useState(generateData());

    const rowRenderer = ({ item, focusRepeatContext }: CreateListRenderItemInfo<any>) => {
        return (
            <Pressable
                style={styles.packshot}
                focusRepeatContext={focusRepeatContext}
                focusOptions={{
                    animator: {
                        type: 'border',
                        focus: {
                            borderColor: 'blue',
                            borderWidth: 5,
                        },
                    },
                }}
            >
                <Image source={{ uri: item.backgroundImage }} style={styles.image} />
            </Pressable>
        );
    };

    return (
        <App>
            <Screen style={styles.recyclerContainer}>
                <FlashList data={data} renderItem={rowRenderer} horizontal type="row" />
            </Screen>
        </App>
    );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

## Props

It inherits all the properties from [Shopify Flash List](https://github.com/Shopify/flash-list). However this version
is optimized to work with multi platform environment and our Focus Manager so it has some API changes which is described below.

<Prop value="type" />
<Badge value="Android TV, Fire TV, Apple TV, webOS, Tizen" platform />{' '}

Type: _grid | row_

Describes type of list either is grid or row. It helps focus manager to navigate.

<Prop value="rowRenderer" />
<Badge required />{' '}

Type: _CreateListRenderItemInfo_

Pressable or TouchableOpacity component in your return.
