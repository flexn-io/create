# Screen

Wrapper component which should be wrapping each screen. It has actual functionality only for TV platform for the rest it just passing through default React Native View.
Screen defines the context of the page and tells Focus Manager about your app structure. Screen can't ever be inside another Screen.

## Usage
```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import { Text } from 'react-native';
import { App, Screen, StyleSheet } from '@flexn/create';

const MyScreen = () => {
  return (
    <App>
      <Screen style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Hello from Flexn Create SDK!</Text>
      </Screen>
    </App>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 22,
  },
});

export default MyScreen;
```
