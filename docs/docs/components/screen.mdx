# Screen

import * as React from 'react';
import { Text } from 'react-native';
import { App, Screen, StyleSheet } from '@flexn/create';

const MyScreen = () => {
    return (
        <App>
            <Screen style={styles.container}>
                <Text style={styles.text}>Hello from Flexn Create!</Text>
            </Screen>
        </App>
    );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
        backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF',
    },
